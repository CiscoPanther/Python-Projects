These blocks of code work together to SSH into a network device, 
make changes to the configuration or run show commands for configuration analysis.
The code checks the validity of an IP address and Subnet Mask then confirms that the IP address 
file exists in a folder on your machine. The code uses paramiko to handle SSH, so you need SSH installed in your environment.
